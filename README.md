**Simple, not easy.**

Welcome to my lab — a space for curiosity, code, and quiet obsession.

This is a new season in my coding journey. Everything here is part of my training — lessons, challenges, and ideas I build as I learn.  
*Still learning. Still building. Always exploring.*  
**Learning by failing.**

### 🧠 What I’m focusing on
Right now I’m deep in the **Data Engineering world**, laying strong foundations in:

- `Python` 🐍 (my home language)  
- `SQL` 💾 (I see the matrix)  
- `pandas` / `numpy` (still messy, but getting it)  
- `Apache Spark` (on the roadmap)  
- `Databricks` (certifications coming soon)

After that, it’s time to go deeper into **Machine Learning**.  
Not to chase buzzwords — but to **build stuff that works**.

### 🌌 While I code
I’m probably listening to something cinematic, ambient or emotional.  
Music helps me write cleaner loops and dirtier prompts.

### 💎 What you’ll find here
This is a snapshot of my journey. A digital lab of curiosity and quiet momentum.  
It’ll change with me — and that’s the whole point.

If you find something useful here — cool.  
If not — I wasn’t building it for you anyway.

**Never Stop Building.**
This is the way.
